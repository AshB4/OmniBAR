### Sample Responses

**ArxivQueryAgent (Score: 0.7)**:
> "FlashAttention 2 improves upon FlashAttention by introducing better work partitioning to address inefficiencies. Specifically, it tweaks the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs, parallelizes the attention computation across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and distributes the work between warps within each thread block to reduce communication through shared memory."

**WikipediaQueryAgent (Score: 0.0)**:
> "I'm sorry, but I couldn't find specific information on the key algorithmic changes in FlashAttention 2 compared to FlashAttention, including the specific tiling strategy and complexity claims, on Wikipedia."
